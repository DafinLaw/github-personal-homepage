This project was built with the sole purpose of challenging myself and as well as linking it to other projects. 
This project is a web-version cv/resume built by me using HTML & CSS. 
The project displays an A4 format box on a background of a blue color. It is surrounded by shadow and the border has a dark blue tint as accent. 
Inside: From the top we have the profile picture of me, my name, profession, current technologies that I have experimented with
  and a big download button for the pdf version of the cv which I am currently working on for improvement.
  A bit lower we have the social buttons and some addresses. Lower, separated by a transparent white like, we have the 4 blocks:
  Skills, Profile, Projects and Experience&Education.
  Skills block contains the current skills I am experimenting with;
  Profile block contains a sumarized description of me;
  Projects block contains 4 projects displayed in a grid fashion(here I challenged myself and learned some principles about grid ahead of time)
    The 4 projects are:
      - Business Card: the first time I used a hover effect, failed lamentably and only ended up with a zoom in instead of what I wanted;
        It contains a picture of me, some border design, my name, aspiring fututre position/role and location;
      - Space Layout Landing Page: the first time I got to experiment with gifs and webp formats, the cover image and logos with transparent backgrounds;
      - Hometown Homepage: here I combined the previous skills and also used "linear-gradient" to make the background in one part of the webpage a gradient;
      - Rabbit Counter: The first time I have integrated JavaScript into a webpage. Counting Rabbits has never been easier!
  Experience & Education block: contains first the most relevant to this line of work experience,
  I have worked in other places before, consisting of around 3 years of experience, now going to 4.
  Secondly, the education also display the most relevant education obtained, that is IT School's Cybersecurity cours which in Romania the degree/profession equivalates to Helper Programmer.

And at the bottom it displays the ownership of the webpage.

Stretch goals:
  - obtain a more responsive design;
  - add more projects;
  - create a pdf file that strongly resembles the website layout and design, with working links and less personal information
    thus for the time being the download button will be disabled.
